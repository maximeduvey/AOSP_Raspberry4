This project is a litle side project i'm doing on my free-time to better understand AOSP and explore funny features.

If you are reading this, please note that as I'm writting theses lines this is not a "demonstrator" and has no amibition of being a perfect example of what I can do, time is a limited ressources and multiple project already await my work (hello robotic cup).

If you read this it mean I ended putting this repo in public, and if you find this interesting and have some questions, please don't hesitate, I'll be glad to answer and help you.
